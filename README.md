# Introduction
In this project, I predicted whether an adult's income exceeds $50K/year based on attributes such as education level, race, gender, hours worked per week, type of employment, and marital status using a machine learning model.

# Data Preprocessing
Import Libraries: Import pandas for data handling and scikit-learn for machine learning:

# import pandas as pd
# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
Read Data: Read the dataset and handle missing values if any:

income_data = pd.read_csv('income_data.csv')
Split Data: Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y):

X = income_data.drop(['income'], axis=1)
Y = income_data['income']
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numeric format using one-hot encoding or label encoding:

X = pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True)
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1234, stratify=Y)

# Model Training
Select Machine Learning Model: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.) based on the problem requirements:

# from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1234)
Fit and Train the Model: Train the model on the training data:
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Evaluation
Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall):
accuracy = model.score(X_test, Y_test)
Confusion Matrix: Optionally, analyze model predictions using a confusion matrix for further insights:

# from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
cm = confusion_matrix(Y_test, predictions)

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict adult income based on demographic and employment-related features. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and 
optionally a confusion matrix.
